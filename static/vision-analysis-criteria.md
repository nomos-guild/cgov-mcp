# Cardano Governance Voting Principles 2025–2030

## Aligned with Cardano Vision 2030 KPIs

---

## 1. Overview

This document establishes voting principles for Cardano treasury funding decisions from 2025 through 2030. These principles are designed to:

- Achieve all 9 Vision 2030 KPIs by end of 2030
- Distribute 1,000M ADA in total budget across 5 years
- Front-load funding to accelerate early-stage progress
- Ensure accountability through recognized ecosystem participants

---

## 2. Budget Framework

### 2.1 Annual Net Change Limit (NCL)

| Year      | NCL (ADA)         |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| 2025      | 200,000,000       |
| 2026      | 200,000,000       |
| 2027      | 200,000,000       |
| 2028      | 200,000,000       |
| 2029      | 200,000,000       |
| **Total** | **1,000,000,000** |

### 2.2 Per-KPI Budget Allocation

With 9 equally-weighted KPIs, each KPI receives:

**111,111,111 ADA (~111.1M ADA)** over the 5-year period

## 3. The 9 Vision 2030 KPIs

| #   | KPI                                | Current Status | 2030 Target              | Budget Allocation |
| --- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1   | **Total Value Locked (TVL)**       | $200M          | $3B                      | 111.1M ADA        |
| 2   | **Monthly Transactions**           | 800k/month     | ≥27M/month               | 111.1M ADA        |
| 3   | **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**     | 100k-300k      | 1M                       | 111.1M ADA        |
| 4   | **Monthly Uptime**                 | 99.98%         | 99.98%                   | 111.1M ADA        |

## 4. Front-Loaded Funding Model

### 4.1 Rationale

Early investment in KPI achievement produces compounding returns. Initial infrastructure, research, and ecosystem building require higher capital intensity. Later stages benefit from momentum, network effects, and proven foundations.

### 4.2 10-Partition Funding Distribution

Each KPI's 111.1M ADA budget is distributed across 10 progress partitions (each representing 10% of KPI completion):

| Progress Partition | % of KPI Budget | ADA per Partition | Frontload Multiplier | Cumulative % |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| 0% → 10%           | 18%             | 20,000,000        | 1.8x                 | 18%          |
| 10% → 20%          | 15%             | 16,667,000        | 1.5x                 | 33%          |
| 20% → 30%          | 13%             | 14,444,000        | 1.3x                 | 46%          |
| 30% → 40%          | 11%             | 12,222,000        | 1.1x                 | 57%          |
| 40% → 50%          | 10%             | 11,111,000        | 1.0x                 | 67%          |
| 50% → 60%          | 9%              | 10,000,000        | 0.9x                 | 76%          |
| 60% → 70%          | 8%              | 8,889,000         | 0.8x                 | 84%          |
| 70% → 80%          | 7%              | 7,778,000         | 0.7x                 | 91%          |
| 80% → 90%          | 5%              | 5,556,000         | 0.5x                 | 96%          |
| 90% → 100%         | 4%              | 4,444,000         | 0.4x                 | 100%         |

### 4.3 Interpretation

- **First 30% of progress** receives **46% of budget** (~51.1M ADA per KPI)
- **Last 30% of progress** receives **16% of budget** (~17.8M ADA per KPI)
- Funding intensity ratio: **First 10% gets 4.5× more than last 10%**

---

## 5. Recognized Party Requirement

### 5.1 First 30% Milestone Gate

For proposals targeting the **first 30% of any KPI's progress**, the following requirement applies:

> **Proposals MUST be submitted by or in formal collaboration with recognized ecosystem parties with proven capability.**

### 5.2 Definition of Recognized Parties

A "recognized party" is an entity that meets **at least TWO** of the following criteria:

1. **Established Ecosystem Entity**: Organizations or individuals with a demonstrated history of creating value for the Cardano ecosystem (e.g., core contributors, major dApp builders, infrastructure providers, long-standing community organizations)
2. **Track Record**: Demonstrated successful delivery of at least 2 prior funded projects in Cardano ecosystem (Catalyst or Treasury)
3. **Technical Expertise**: Recognized contributors to Cardano core protocol, major dApps, or infrastructure with verifiable on-chain history
4. **Institutional Standing**: Registered organization with public accountability (foundation, company, DAO with transparent governance)

### 5.3 Collaboration Requirements

For proposals involving collaboration with a recognized party:

- **Formal Agreement**: Written MOU or partnership agreement must be referenced
- **Defined Roles**: Clear delineation of responsibilities between parties
- **Accountability**: Recognized party accepts co-responsibility for milestone delivery
- **Verification**: Recognized party must publicly confirm collaboration before vote

### 5.4 Rationale

Early-stage funding carries highest risk. Requiring proven entities ensures:

- Technical feasibility assessment
- Execution capability validation
- Ecosystem alignment
- Accountability structures

After 30% progress is achieved, the KPI pathway is de-risked, allowing broader participation.

## 6. Voting Decision Framework

### 6.1 Preliminary Filter: Team Capability

Before evaluating proposal merits, DReps should apply a **pass/fail filter**:

> **Does the proposing team demonstrate sufficient capability to execute?**

| Filter              | Pass                                                 | Fail                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Team Capability** | Team shows reasonable evidence of ability to deliver | No credible execution capacity demonstrated |

**Mental Model: Value Creation vs. Resource Consumption**

When assessing team capability, consider whether the team has historically **created more value than they have consumed** in the Cardano ecosystem. Ideally:

> **Cumulative value created by the team ≥ Budget requested**

Teams that have a track record of delivering outsized value relative to past funding represent lower risk and higher expected ROI for the treasury.

_If FAIL → Proposal should not proceed to weighted evaluation._

### 6.2 Weighted Evaluation Criteria

For proposals that pass the capability filter, DReps should prioritize:

| Priority | Criterion                                                                     | Weight |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1        | **KPI Alignment**: Does proposal directly advance one or more of the 9 KPIs?  | 35%    |
| 2        | **Measurable Impact**: Are deliverables quantifiable against KPI metrics?     | 30%    |
| 3        | **Cost Efficiency**: Is budget request proportional to expected KPI progress? | 20%    |
| 4        | **Risk Mitigation**: Are milestones, escrow, or clawback mechanisms in place? | 15%    |

### 6.3 Budget Alignment Check

Before voting YES, DReps should verify:

- [ ] Proposal's requested amount fits within remaining budget for the targeted KPI
- [ ] Proposal targets appropriate progress partition based on current KPI status
- [ ] If targeting first 30%, recognized party requirement is satisfied
- [ ] Funding intensity matches the partition's allocated budget cap

### 6.3 Progress Tracking

The community should maintain public dashboards tracking:

1. Current status of each KPI against 2030 target
2. Cumulative funding deployed per KPI
3. Remaining budget per KPI partition
4. Proposals approved/pending per KPI

---

## 7. Annual Review & Adjustment

### 7.1 Annual Assessment

At the end of each calendar year, the community should:

1. **Measure Progress**: Evaluate actual KPI advancement vs. expectations
2. **Rebalance if Needed**: Consider shifting unused partition budgets to higher-priority KPIs
3. **Update Recognized Parties**: Refresh the list of qualifying entities based on performance
4. **Adjust Weights**: If certain KPIs prove more/less expensive, modify allocation

### 7.2 Mid-Cycle Rebalancing Rules

If by end of Year 3 (2027):

- A KPI is **>70% achieved**: Surplus budget may be reallocated to lagging KPIs
- A KPI is **<30% achieved**: Emergency review triggered; strategy reassessment required
- **NCL underspent by >20%**: Carry forward or accelerate funding for highest-impact KPIs
